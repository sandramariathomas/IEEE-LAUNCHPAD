#### Career Plan:
Immediate Plans
To contribute to the Kerala startup ecosystem, I will leverage my experience in organizing impactful events and fostering collaborations. My immediate goal is to conduct workshops on emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT, building on my experience with events such as WinterHack and iTalks Series. Additionally, I will organize regular hackathons like Beyond the Loop to encourage problem-solving and innovation among students.

Strengthening university-industry collaboration is a priority. I plan to bring industry experts to campuses for guest lectures and seminars, leveraging my network from events like AWS UG Kochi Meetups. Facilitating more internship opportunities with local startups and tech companies, using my experience as an IEDC CEO, will provide students with valuable hands-on experience.

Enhancing mentorship programs is crucial. I will establish a robust mentorship network, drawing from my connections in IEEE, Tinkerhub, and various startup communities. Encouraging senior students and successful alumni to mentor juniors, as I did at Tinkerhub Learning Station, will foster a collaborative learning environment. Promoting inclusive innovation, I will organize events aimed at supporting women in technology and entrepreneurship and extend startup activities to rural areas to nurture talent beyond urban centers.

Longer-Term Plans
For the long term, I envision creating innovation hubs across Kerala. Establishing more incubators and accelerators, inspired by the IEDC model, will provide essential resources, mentorship, and funding to early-stage startups. Setting up fabrication laboratories and maker spaces will facilitate prototyping and product development.

Developing a strong funding ecosystem is vital. I aim to strengthen angel investor networks and encourage high-net-worth individuals to invest in local startups, leveraging my connections as an IEEE Xtreme Ambassador. Advocating for more government-backed grants and subsidies, especially for early-stage startups, will provide necessary financial support.

Building global connections is another key aspect. Fostering partnerships with international startups, incubators, and investors will give Kerala startups global exposure. Organizing and participating in global tech conferences and startup events, leveraging my role in events like Google I/O Extended, will help showcase Kerala’s innovation on an international stage.

Fostering a culture of continuous learning is essential. Implementing ongoing education and upskilling programs through platforms like Tinkerhub and IEEE will ensure students and professionals are well-equipped with the latest knowledge and skills. Encouraging collaborative research between universities and industry, as demonstrated in projects like SmartFruit and VegTrack, will lead to innovative startups.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala can excel in the technology startup ecosystem by focusing on education and skill development. Strengthening STEM education at all levels will build a solid foundation for future entrepreneurs. Introducing coding and digital literacy programs from an early age, inspired by my efforts with Tinkerhub WIT Foundation Course, will develop a tech-savvy generation.

Leveraging Kerala’s unique strengths is crucial. Utilizing the state’s robust IT infrastructure and high internet penetration will support tech startups. Encouraging tech solutions for Kerala’s tourism and agriculture sectors, based on my project experiences like SmartFruit and VegTrack, will help leverage the state’s natural strengths.

Creating a supportive regulatory environment will make it easier to start and run a business in Kerala. Simplifying regulatory processes and advocating for startup-friendly policies, inspired by my engagement with KSUM, will reduce compliance burdens and offer incentives for innovation. Promoting a culture of innovation through regular state-wide innovation challenges and competitions will stimulate creative solutions to local problems. Highlighting and celebrating local startup success stories, using platforms like IEEE and Tinkerhub, will inspire and motivate budding entrepreneurs.
