Hi,
      
       I am Rinshida ,I am 21 years old andI am come from Manjeri .I recently graduated B.tech in computer science and engineering from Eranad knowledge City Technical Campus Manjeri.
I have completed my secondary school with science stream from C H M K M H S S Iruvetty.My technical skills are Nodejs, Express, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 
Apart from technical skills are i have soft skills like leadership qualities and presentation skill. 
I have done two projects during my sixth and eight'th semester that are "Detection and Elimination of cyberbullying using Machine learning"
and "Multi-step forecasting in municipal solid waste generation using LSTM-LR Model" respectively. 

Detection and Elimination of cyberbullying using Machine learning : The project involved leveraging machine learning algorithms, 
specifically Support Vector Machines(SVM) and Logistic Regression, for the detection and
elimination of cyberbullying. Through careful implementation and fine-turning of these models. we aimed to identify
and address harmful online behavior. contributing to the creation of safer digital world

Multi-step forecasting in municipal solid waste generation using LSTM-LR Model Utilized LSTM-LR
models to predict future waste amounts. This approach allowed for accurate predictions over multiple times.
Enhancing the ability to plan and manage municipal waste effectively. The LSTM-LR model demonstrated its proficiency
in capturing temporal dependencies, contributing to more informed decision-making in the context or waste management.

From these projects i learned python django framework well.

My short term goal is to get a job in reputed company where I can build my career and improve my knowledge.
and my long term goal is to get a respected job in reputed company.

that's all about me...
