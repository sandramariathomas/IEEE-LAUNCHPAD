### About Me

I am a motivated B.Tech Computer Science graduate with a passion for software development. My journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set, and I thrive on solving complex problems. Backend technologies and the fascinating world of AI have always captured my interest.

My technical expertise lies in React, Django, and Python. I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects, including a Project Management System developed using Django and Flutter. This showcased my versatility in both web and mobile app development. Additionally, I created a Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV, emphasizing my skills in computer vision.

During my internship at Ellow.io, I contributed to an advanced E-commerce Website built with React. This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also highlighted the importance of collaboration and teamwork in software development.

As a problem solver, I enjoy dissecting complex challenges and finding elegant solutions. I firmly believe that great software is a result of collective effort, and I’m eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals to create meaningful applications.

| Project Management System  | The Project Management System is a robust web and mobile application built using Django and Flutter. Its purpose is to streamline B.Tech project management by providing a centralized platform for students, faculty, and administrators. Key features include project idea management, timely notifications, progress tracking, online submission, grading, and an archive of past projects done by seniors.                                              | N/A    | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/samueljohn18/Project-Management-System)             |
| Face Recognition Attendance System  | The Face Recognition Attendance System is a project that automates student attendance using OpenCV. It captures students’ faces via a webcam, extracts facial landmarks, and compares them with a database of enrolled students. When a match is found, the student’s attendance is automatically marked. This system streamlines classroom management, reduces administrative workload, and ensures both efficiency and accuracy                  | N/A    | [GitHUb Repo](https://github.com/samueljohn18/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System)        |
