| **Multi-Class Lung Disease Classifier using Deep Learning and Image Processing**  | In response to COVID-19 and the subsequent rise in lung-related issues, this project aims to develop a deep learning architecture for multi-class classification of pneumonia, lung cancer, tuberculosis, lung opacity, and COVID-19. The project utilizes a pre-trained model VGG19 followed by three blocks of convolutional neural network (CNN) along with image processing for the desired results.| [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Student Attendance Using Fingerprint**  | The system described in this project aims to replace the traditional methods of attendance taking by introducing a biometric attendance system that will be time efficient and environment friendly. The desired project is designed by interfacing a fingerprint sensor with Arduino, LCD Display, and RTC Module.| [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
