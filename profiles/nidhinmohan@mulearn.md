#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have been part of my school basketball team while I was atudying in 6th standard onwards. The primary aim/goal for me is to get slim as I was very much out in shape and I joined my school team. Initial one to two years were the ridiculous days as a noobie like me breaking out of the comfort zone and entering the world of basketball had altogether changed myself. From there, when I reached my 11th standard was my prime time in my basketball team. That day finally came and I had be chosen the Team captain for our school team. My fellow team mates always follows my commands thoughout my journey with them and at this very moment, whenever I see my juniors, they always praise on me how I managed to make them play for our team made them play in very good teams across the countries.
- My greatest strength I have witnessed from within me is the ability to convince people. And that too in this technological word with a lot of tech stuff all around, my close friends and their circle of friends had a clear cut idea of what they are purchasing for themseleves (example is phones, laptops etc.) and I am the one who always influenced them in choosing the right one. The never ending love to know more about tech has equiped me with this wonderful skill I possess and enables me to help a lot of people by my suggestions.  

#### Networking:

- As an introvert person, I usually avoid communities and stuff and try to be all alone for myself and in this world of oppurtunities, being a person like this has made me lost a lot of potential oppurtunites as well and that is were this platform, that is MuLearn community has changed me from what I am. This community was introduced to me by my very close friend I had in my college and he told me if you can make use of this platform, you can network with a lot of like minded people and will experience a growth inn yourself and hence I am here. So, this my very first community to be part of and I hope this community will help me grow in all aspects. As I mentioned previously, getting to know the latest techs and trends has enough potential to change the society as many people tend to fall on the wrong places and regret it after. So, I request all my fellow friends to get in touch with latest trends around us and get to know about it.

#### Career Plan:

- As an engineering graduate, I always wanted to become a software developer at the Big Fours and give out the best I can to the world. But currently, due to personal concerns, I am doing a full time job at my native place itself, that is Trivandrum, along with following my passion for coding. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's Tech Ecosystem has become a lot better than it was in the past few years. The main factors in the substantial growth of our ecosystem is the initiative of several Governtment and Non Governmental organisations towards entrepreneurial culture. The Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) is the torch bearer to this initiative by implementing several idealogies and policies to create a vibrant startup possibilites for the younger generation.
- Also, nowadays, the startup ideas from our young minds are tremendous to be put in practice which can lead to high growth in the economy of our state in every possible ways. This is due to the unique model in our state that connects academics, industries, research institutions and so on. This intergration helps our young minds to develop and implement their ideas at the same time.
