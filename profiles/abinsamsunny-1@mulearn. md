| **Project Name 1  HAND GESTURE CONTROLLED WHEELCHAIR

FOR DISABLED PEOPLE| Description of the project 1   The wheelchair is one of the most commonly used assistive devices to promote mobility and

enhance quality of life for people who have difficulties in walking.The “HANDGESTURE

CONTROLLED WHEELCHAIR FOR DISABLED PEOPLE” introduces a groundbreak-

ing wheelchair control system designed to respond to hand gestures, specifically tailored

to cater to the needs of the elderly.A gesture-controlled wheelchair is a specialized type of

movable device that allows individuals to control the motion of a wheelchair using hand

movements.This technology is particularly beneficial for people who are unable to move

their lower limbs. Central to its functionality is a hand gesture recognition algorithm that

translates the wrist movements into essential commands, encompassing forward, reverse,

left, right. This innovative design is characterized by a commitment to simplicity, inten-

tionally avoiding the intricate complexities often associated with conventional computing

systems. This deliberate choice not only streamlines user interaction but also significantly

enhances accessibility for elderly individuals who may face challenges with technology.The

transmitter part which is embedded in a gloves detect the gesture and the receiver part

which is in the wheelchair receives the transmitted signal and move according to the given

direction.In essence, this comprehensive approach positions the wheelchair as a promising

solution at the intersection of innovation and accessibility, addressing the unique needs of

individuals requiring mobility assistance.The main aim is to move the wheelchair by the

user independently. By seamlessly blending advanced technology with user-friendly design

principles, this wheelchair system stands out as a beacon of progress in the field, promising

a more inclusive and adaptable future for those in need of mobility support.                                           | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
