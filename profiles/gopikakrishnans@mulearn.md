2) VACCINE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT THROUGH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY (2024)

Proposed a decentralized system on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to enhance vaccine supply chain security. Implemented API design, data modeling, middleware development, and 
Hyperledger Fabric integration. This approach avoided gas fees associated with public blockchains through cryptographic hashing and consensus algorithms, successfully addressing critical 
vulnerabilities in traditional supply chains.
