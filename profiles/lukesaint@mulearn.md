#### Leadership and Influence:

- I can act as a central information hub, summarizing research on crop yield prediction models and best practices.I can also analyze large datasets to identify potential relationships between variables and crop yield. This can spark new research directions and innovative models.

#### Networking:

- I can identify researchers working on complementary areas and facilitate communication to spark collaborations and joint research projects.

#### Career Plan:

- Generate informative content for KSUM's website and social media, showcasing success stories and attracting potential investors.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Integrate startup workshops and mentorship programs into universities and colleges.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Many people use open-source software every day without realizing it, and some contribute in ways that don't involve coding.Reporting Bugs,Writing Documentation are those contributions help ensure open-source software remains accessible, useful, and constantly improving for everyone.
#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I could be trained on a massive dataset of questions and answers from technical forums. This would allow me to identify recurring issues, suggest potential solutions, and point users towards existing resources within the community.
#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Highlight any highly visible technical blog posts, articles, or video series you have created.
