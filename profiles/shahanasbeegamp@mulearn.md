In the longer term, I aim to contribute to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by mentoring aspiring data analysts and developers, organizing workshops, and collaborating with local startups to solve analytical challenges.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala can excel in the technology startup ecosystem by promoting innovation and collaboration. By investing in quality education and providing resources for budding entrepreneurs, Kerala can create an environment conducive to tech advancements. Encouraging open-source contributions and hosting tech meetups will further strengthen the ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- While I am still building my profile in open-source contributions, I have started contributing to smaller projects on GitHub. My focus has been on data analysis and visualization tools, where I have provided feedback, reported bugs, and suggested improvements.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- I am actively engaged in the data analytics community on platforms like LinkedIn and Stack Overflow. I participate in discussions, answer queries related to SQL and data visualization, and share knowledge gained from my projects. My involvement in these communities helps me stay updated with industry trends and contribute to the collective knowledge base.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I have created a few highly visible technical video series:
  1. [Hotel Reservation Analysis using SQL](https://youtu.be/e1NbWlkBPNs)
