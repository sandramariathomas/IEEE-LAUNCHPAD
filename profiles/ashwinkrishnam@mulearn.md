#### Leadership and Influence:

- Explain how you meet the requirement for being a leader or influencer in your domain. Provide clear examples of your leadership and influencing skills.

#### Career Plan:

In the immediate term, my primary focus is to secure a position as a junior developer in a reputable organization. By joining a dynamic team, I aim to gain hands-on experience and further develop my technical skills in web development and software engineering.
My long-term goal is to evolve into a proficient full-stack developer with expertise in a wide range of technologies.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has a good tech ecosystem .But I think the real problem lies in the Education system,especially in studies after 12th.
Students are learning the outdated and unwanted subjects in their college.
