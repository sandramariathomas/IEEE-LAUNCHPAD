#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have taken part in a variety of volunteer activities. One recent example is being a mentor for a Google Cloud event called "Study Jam," where I demonstrated my abilities by coaching and guiding fellow students in completing Google Cloud labs.

#### Networking:

- Even though I am cautious about approaching new people, I enjoy connecting with people of diverse perspectives, and it is always a delight and somewhat encouraging to meet new people who have their own opinions¬†ideas, passions, and interest groups.

#### Career Plan:

- Launchpad with GTech Mulearn, in my opinion, is a fantastic spot for me to sharpen my abilities and increase my self-assurance. Despite my lack of experience with computers, I'm committed to helping her become more proficient.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The digital ecosystem in Kerala is a commendable endeavor that seeks to foster and enhance the startup culture. Young people with an entrepreneurial mindset are becoming more prevalent as a result. For young aspirants interested in startup missions, it will be helpful.
