### About Me

I am a dedicated web developer currently pursuing a B.Tech at Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science. My passion for emerging technologies and programming has driven me to continuously enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest industry trends. 

With intermediate proficiency in React.js and Next.js, I have developed a strong foundation in building dynamic and responsive web applications. React.js has allowed me to create interactive user interfaces with ease, while Next.js has provided me with the tools to build server-side rendered applications, improving performance and SEO.

In addition to my expertise in these frameworks, I have also gained experience with animation libraries such as GSAP and Framer Motion. These tools have enabled me to add engaging and smooth animations to my projects, enhancing the overall user experience. I enjoy exploring the creative possibilities these libraries offer and integrating them into my web development projects.

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have helped me apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate with others, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to innovative projects. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and passion for technology to create impactful web solutions that make a difference.

As I continue to grow and develop as a web developer, I am excited about the possibilities that the future holds. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with web technologies and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of the tech industry.
