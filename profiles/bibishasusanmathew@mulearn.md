### About Me
Hello, I'm Bibisha Susan Mathew, a dedicated student currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a passion for technology and a keen interest in AI, I'm eager to explore the endless possibilities it offers to transform industries and improve lives.
In the realm of programming, I bring proficiency in Python, C, HTML, and CSS. My journey in software and web development began with an enriching internship experience at Sysbreeze Technologies, Calicut, where I honed my skills and gained practical insights into building dynamic web applications.
Driven by a desire to apply AI in healthcare, I undertook notable projects during my academic journey. One such project involved developing a system for depression detection using sentiment analysis techniques. Additionally, I led a team in our main project focused on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification of chest diseases, aiming to assist healthcare professionals in accurate diagnosis.
Beyond academics, I actively engage in various extracurricular activities. I serve as a member of the National Service Scheme (NSS) and have taken on leadership roles as a class representative and as the lead of the AI club. These experiences have not only enriched my interpersonal skills but also instilled in me a sense of responsibility towards community engagement and social impact.

## Career Plan:
In the immediate term, I aim to further deepen my knowledge and skills in AI and machine learning through continued learning and practical projects. I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge research and innovation in the field, leveraging AI to address real-world challenges.
As I progress in my career, I envision myself playing a role in advancing healthcare technologies, particularly in the realm of medical image analysis and diagnosis. I aspire to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to develop AI-driven solutions that enhance medical diagnostics and improve patient outcomes.

## History of Community Engagement:
I actively participate in community service activities through NSS and contribute to fostering a culture of social responsibility within our college community.
